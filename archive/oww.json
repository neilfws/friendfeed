I'd say recording that process, along with all the failed experiments (and the conditions that led to them) would be very valuable.  Very much like what we'd like to do in our experiments.

The MD simulations I was thinking of actually took significant time on a supercomputer for each tweak (I think).  So, that would be practical to record everything and treat it as an experiment.  Clearly, though, as you say there are cases where it would be very difficult to capture everything.  This is true in some experiments, too, though!  For example I remember in the Collider Detector Facility (CDF) at Fermilab, the first round of data acquisition was all hardware and the job was to filter out 90% (or whatever fraction) of the data so that the bandwidth of the next steps would be sufficient.

Or, Deepak pointed out Virtual Machines to me as a way of packaging a computational environment.  So it seems easier to at least transfer some of the tacit knowledge.  In a wetlab, it's still not possible to do that.
