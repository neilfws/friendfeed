However, with more and more scientists communicating research findings in digital format in many different ways does the notion of the scientific ‘article’ itself remain relevant? Is the traditional research paper still the optimal format for the dissemination of the outputs of scientific research? If not, what are the alternatives? Video Killed the Methods Section More and more scientific findings are ‘born digital’. The traditional format of research article is being transformed into a multi-media digital object with linked content, video, audio, datasets and reader annotation. This raises new possibilities and challenges. How should these newer types of content be peer reviewed? Are researchers really able to make the most of them? Does a link to a dataset or image always provide sufficient context to enable informed re-use or validation? Share and Share Alike Scientific researchers are both producers and consumers of data and information. Outside of the peer-reviewed article, what mechanisms are available for ensuring standards of quality in both contexts? Should they differ, and if so, why? On Common Ground Open access publishing, data sharing initiatives and Science Commons aim to open up access to research information. What social, legal, economical and technological challenges remain to enable global access to the outputs of scientific research? Is it really practicable to manage the outputs from publicly-funded research as a public good, and if not, why?

For in a world without copyright of academic writing, academics would still benefit from publishing in the major way that they do now, namely, from gaining scholarly esteem. Yet publishers would presumably have to impose fees on authors, because publishers would not be able to profit from reader charges. If these publication fees would be borne by academics, their incentives to publish would be reduced. But if the publication fees would usually be paid by universities or grantors, the motive of academics to publish would be unlikely to decrease (and could actually increase) – suggesting that ending academic copyright would be socially desirable in view of the broad benefits of a copyright-free world.

A four line summary is available here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience/References\" title=\"http://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience/References\">http://wiki.debian.org/DebianS...</a> This year, some progresses are being made. For the display, Andreas has modified the ‘Web sentinels’ so that they can display bibliographic informations. See <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://debian-med.alioth.debian.org/tasks/bio\" title=\"http://debian-med.alioth.debian.org/tasks/bio\">http://debian-med.alioth.debian.org/tasks...</a> for instance. But currently the limitation of the system is that the bibliographic information is in a quite remote location, in the Blends ‘tasks’ files. I am currently working on a new workflow which would help the maintainers to document bibliographic information and much more, and would be very interested to hear your comments. As Michael suggested initially, for bibliographyait consists in having ‘DOI’ or ‘PubMed’ fields in a file contained in the source package, in that case ‘debian/upstream-metadata.yaml’. When the package is stored in a VCS, it is quite easy to extract it and to assemble package summaries. See for instance the following URLs: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://upstream-metadata.debian.net/table/DOI\" title=\"http://upstream-metadata.debian.net/table/DOI\">http://upstream-metadata.debian.net/table...</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://upstream-metadata.debian.net/table/Homepage\" title=\"http://upstream-metadata.debian.net/table/Homepage\">http://upstream-metadata.debian.net/table...</a> I hope these tables can be pipelined into the ‘Ultimate Debian Database’ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase\" title=\"http://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase\">http://wiki.debian.org/Ultimat...</a>) and be the basis for the generation of our Blends ‘Web sentinels’. A discussion takes place on the debian-QA mailing list: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://lists.debian.org/msgid-search/20091022074910.GA20846@an3as.eu\" title=\"http://lists.debian.org/msgid-search/20091022074910.GA20846@an3as.eu\">http://lists.debian.org/msgid-s...</a> Please feel free to join it if you would like. For the more specific target of documenting references, I propose to reopen here the discussion started by Michael. Whole BibTeX bibliographies can be stored: ‘<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://upstream-metadata.debian.net/table/Reference’\" title=\"http://upstream-metadata.debian.net/table/Reference’\">http://upstream-metadata.debian.net/table...</a>;. BibTeX is not the only reference format, but has the advantage of being used by most publishers for citation retreival (but not for paper subission…). Nevertheless, if there are good reasons to not store monolithic BibTeX references and use another format or approach, I would be very interested to hear them.

As an alternative to downloading the whole thing, you can look through the source code in a web browser here. The scripts are written to run on Unix; they might work on MacOS X, but I haven't tried. Licensing information is given on the copyright page of the PDF version of each book, and also in the photo credits section in the back.  To download the source code, you need to install free software called Git, e.g., by doing sudo apt-get install git-core on Ubuntu Linux. Then do this from a terminal window:          git clone git://lightandmatter.com/physics         This will create a subdirectory physics inside your current working directory, and then download everything into that subdirectory.

The cake test is inspired by the dissident test and the desert island test used by the Debian community to gauge software freedom for packages to be included in a free and open distribution.

His comments didn't make it into the story, so I thought I'd add them here (a luxury I don't normally have!): Q: How many users does OWW have? Of those, how many are actually posting bona fide Open Notebooks, as opposed to, say, just hosting lab\nwebsites? If you don't have exact numbers, can you estimate? What kind of growth are you seeing? Are there any other Open Science/Open Notebook Science trends that you're seeing that might be of interest\nto our readers?\nA. You can get a feel for the general statistics here:\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/Special:Statistics\" title=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/Special:Statistics\">http://openwetware.org/wiki...</a>\n(7423 registered users: which is a gross overestimate of the actual every day users, as is any site like this)\nand here, which gives a better view of daily activity as well as notebooks specific activities:\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/Special:OWWStats\" title=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/Special:OWWStats\">http://openwetware.org/wiki...</a>\nAnother good place to look to see what people are editing at any given time is here:\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges\" title=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges\">http://openwetware.org/wiki...</a>\n\nQ. Many Open Notebook scientists are telling me that OWW is a good (and even necessary) place to start with an Open Notebook, but that it's not sufficient. They're also using, for example, google spreadsheets. Are you planning to roll out any features in the near future (say, the next year or so) that will make OWW a more comprehensive solution for ONS? Is that even a goal for OWW?\nA. We have been trying to be pretty responsive to the needs of the ON contingent on OWW.  We think that people using such notebooks tend to contribute to more knowledge available to the public related to the actual process of doing science, both indirectly by people being exposed to those notebooks, and directly by having more users directly contributing to OWW.  I think the biggest notebook user group comes from the iGEM competition that is held every year.  Since these teams are mostly composed of undergraduates for a mostly friendly competition, they don't mind having their stuff up in public, and secondly, need online collaboration tools to keep a team together to work towards a shared goal.  By being a part of the community, especially a group that is learning about biology, they sometimes have a better incentive to contribute to protocols and other information on the site so that it is easier to find and digest.  \n\nIn terms of actual tools that will help, I think there are a lot coming from the outside that we are thinking of incorporating, but we don't have a massive team, and we are mostly at the mercy of our volunteer community.  So we help where we can (setting up the lab notebook feature for example was something requested by the community, and most of the revisions were spearheaded by folks using the service).  \n \nQ. Any other thoughts about OWW and ONS?\nA.I think on our front, we are engaging many in the ONS community that have been really pioneering stuff by providing them with as many tools as we can.

Where something is directly patentable and the investor is a private citizen or company it _might_ be the case that keeping it private is better (especially in a very large company with good internal communications). But for instance if you are doing early stage exploratory drug development with public money, today, you probably should keep it under wraps because if you don't and can't patent then in the current environment no-one will be prepared to run with it into clinical trials.

And we never presume that we happen to have a body of regulation that makes sense. We always examine. Where it does make sense, we say good for the law, and we encourage people to follow it. But where it makes no sense, our perspective is that the law needs to be changed. This is especially so in the context of copyright — especially so because of the radical changes I described in Observation #1, regarding the scope and reach of copyright law, which now is reaching in ways never intended or planned by the framers of this law.

Repulsive forces are very steep if the atoms are too close to each other, and if you are trying to simulate a condensed phase (liquid, solid, or interfacial) system, it can be hard to know how to make a sensible initial structure.  Packmol is a cool program that appears to solve this problem. It creates an initial point for molecular dynamics simulations by packing molecules in defined regions of space. The packing guarantees that short range repulsive interactions do not disrupt the simulations. The great variety of types of spatial constraints that can be attributed to the molecules, or atoms within the molecules, makes it easy to create ordered systems, such as lamellar, spherical or tubular lipid layers. It works with PDB and XYZ files and appears to be available under the GPL.

It aims to make bibliographic citation links as easy to use as Web links. Its goals are three-fold:      To establish OpenCitations.net, a public RDF triplestore for biomedical literature citations.      (Note: In this context, a bibliographic citation is a reference within a particular citing work to another publication termed the cited work. This use of the word ‘citation’ should be clearly distinguished from the common related use of this word to indicate the cited work itself. Within this application, ‘cite’ and ‘citation’ denote the performative act of citation itself, not the target document of that citation.)      To harvest the reference lists from many current and recent open access journal articles, and to convert these datasets into RDF, starting with those in UK Pubmed Central, those published by the Public Library of Science and Biomed Central, those from other publishers willing for CrossRef to release their data, and articles from other Open Access repositories like EPrints.     To publish these citation datasets as Open Linked Data on the Talis Connected Commons Platform under an open data license in both human- and computer-accessible formats.  As such, the Open Citation Project seeks to promote citation datasets as first class information objects. The reference list from each article processed will be published as an individual named graph, with its own individual Digital Object Identifier (DOI) assigned by the relevant publisher via CrossRef or by the British Library on behalf of the DataCite Project.&quot;", "via" : { "url" : "http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet", "name" : "Bookmarklet" }, "from" : { "type" : "user", "id" : "mikechelen", "name" : "Mike Chelen" }, "id" : "e/1d05e5e378f6452383964d592a14591e/c/5438a00872d240cb8fa4472f02f79832" } ], "to" : [ { "type" : "user", "id" : "mikechelen", "name" : "Mike's feed" }, { "type" : "group", "id" : "opensci-info", "name" : "Open Science Info" }, { "type" : "group", "id" : "science-2-0", "name" : "Science 2.0" }, { "type" : "group", "name" : "Science Commons", "id" : "sciencecommons" }, { "type" : "group", "id" : "okfn-discuss", "name" : "OKFN Discussion" } ], "likes" : [ { "date" : "2011-02-03T11:04:45Z", "from" : { "type" : "user", "id" : "brox", "name" : "Thomas Brox Røst" } }, { "date" : "2011-01-21T15:37:07Z", "from" : { "type" : "user", "id" : "pfanderson", "name" : "Patricia F.
